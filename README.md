# Susceptibility Phantom of the Spinal Cord
Repository following Project Managment for the Brainhack project - summer 2024

In this repository you will find the spinal cord data from 3 patients.
Acquisition parameters are under the megre2d_5echoes_monopolar.pdf

The data is being worked in unison with the Sepia Toolbox [1].

# Background

MRI provides a range of image contrasts typically qualitative i.e. signals reflect 
tissue changes but are not direct measures of the tissue properties.

This repository can create a digital phantom of the spinal cord that allows for 
simulation of MR signal acquisition to assess the parameters for calculating 
susceptibility values of cervical spinal cord.
