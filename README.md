# Susceptibility Phantom of the Spinal Cord
Repository following Project Managment for the Brainhack project - summer 2024

In this repository you will find the spinal cord data from 3 patients.
Acquisition parameters are under the megre2d_5echoes_monopolar.pdf

The data is being worked in unison with the Sepia Toolbox.

Iterative work has been done with each patient in order to both 
understand the steps involved in quantitative susceptibility mapping and 
applying them to spinal cord data
