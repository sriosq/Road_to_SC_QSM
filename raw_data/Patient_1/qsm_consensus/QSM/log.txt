FANSI AND MEDI 
Using the configuration from QSM consensus
=> Results show very weird things which might might come from the mask selected
I think that for the last dipole inversion step one must select the mask for only_sc

MEDI 2 & FANSI 2
Trying w mask of only SC
=> M2 no result, makes sense cos theres only 1 region to reference so MEDI region growing won't work 
=> F2 

MEDI 3 
Trying with an eroded only SC radius = 

FANSI 3
None as reference tissue
