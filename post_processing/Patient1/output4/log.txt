trial1
MEDI nonlinear fit for echo phase combination 
Region Growing with MEDI for phase unwrapping (spatial)
Exluding vocels using residual, threshold 0
weighting map

trial 2
threshold to 0.5

trial 3
spatial phase unwrapping to 3D best path
>> 3D best path algorithm not used a problem in the Wrapper Echo Combine non linear fit

trial 4
returning to same as trial 2 
chaning threshold to 0.9
